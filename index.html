    <h1> Welcome to Private resort </h1>
    <h2> A website for the best private resort in the world. </h2>
    
    <p> This page has been created in order to practice branching and merging  with Git and GitHub. 
        By creating branches, we can work on different versions of the same code in the same repository 
        simultaneously!</p>

   <p> I have not decided if I will make each page unique or not, it really depends on the level of creativy I have
       going on. At Private resort you can find the best views, spacious rooms for your crew. </p>
